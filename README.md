Adding Portfolio post type and custom taxonomy.

## Description  
Adding a Portfolio post type and custom taxonomy called Portfolio Filter.
If you are going to use it on a project, please change the rewrite slug. It is, oddly, set to Infotheek. Honestly, I would probably use CPT UI instead of this plugin, for the simple reason that it gives you a user interface to make changes - or even set it up just how you like it right from the start.

## Changelog  

### 0.0.1 / January 25, 2020
* Added taxonomy
* Added custom post type
